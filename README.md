# Turtle-Crossing-Game
An implementation of Turtle Crossing game using turtle python library.
## How does it work?
When main.py is executed a screen with size 600x600 px will appear. Random cars will be generated on the right side of the screen moving with a constant speed from the rightside to the leftside of the screen. A turtle will show up at the bottom center of the screen. The turtle is controllable with arrow keys. "Up" arrow key moves the turtle upward, "Down" arrow key moves the turtle downward, "Left" arrow key moves the turtle on the left, and "Right" arrow key moves the turtle on the right. The turtle has to move from the bottom of the screen to the top without hitting any of the moving car. If the turtle successfully reaches the top of the screen then the turtle will show up at the bottom center of the screen, the game level will increase by 1 and the speed of cars will increase as well. If the turtle hits any of the moving cars, the game will stop.
